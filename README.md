# AoC-2025
Advent of Code 2025 solution in Bash

---

To run the solution for a specific day and part, use the following command:

```bash
./aoc.sh <day> <part> [--example]
```
- `<day>`: The day of the challenge (1-25)
- `<part>`: The part of the challenge (1 or 2)
- `--example`: Optional flag to run the example input instead of the actual input

This will execute the corresponding script and time its execution.
